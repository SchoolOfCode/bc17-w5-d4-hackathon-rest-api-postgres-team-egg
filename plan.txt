1. Set up & Install app:
- npm install
- npm run dev 
- set up helmet 
- create database on render 
- assign port on .env 
- rename env 
- add db connection string from render 
- check db connection - rewrite simple route handler 

2. Plan and design your database schema (You should have a minimum of 2 tables that are linked with a primary and foreign key)
- use chatbot to design egg theme - use initialisation script to ask bot to create ERD diagram with mermaid 
- use chatbot to create eggy seed data 


3. Write a database initialisation script. Create a SQL script that will:

    a) Drop any existing tables (if they exist)
    npm reset database 
    b) Recreate all the tables based on the schema

    c) Populate the tables with some initial seed data
    


4. Plan out your API routes and resources. Create your requirements tables similar to the one above.
    i Specify end point of handlers 
    ii Add response status & responses eg success, payload 
    iii call helper functions 
4a. Writing helper functions 
    i exporting / importing the functions 
    ii writing query text - the SQL 
    iii connecting SQL + requests code 
    iv using pool to connect to database 
    v return db result to api handler 

5. Set up a basic Express server with a test route, logging middleware and nodemon.

6. Implement CRUD operations using the pg package to interact with your database.

7. Test the API using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.
