1. Set up & Install app:
- npm install
- npm run dev 
- set up helmet 
- create database on render 
- assign port on .env 
- rename env 
- add db connection string from render 
- check db connection 
- create readme

2. Plan and design your database schema (You should have a minimum of 2 tables that are linked with a primary and foreign key)
- use chatbot to design egg theme to create ERD diagram with mermaid 
- use bot to alter initialisation script to create database
- use chatbot to create eggy seed data 

3. Write a database initialisation script. Create a SQL script that will:
- transfer egg theme to database script 
- npm reset database 
    a) Drop any existing tables (if they exist)
    b) Recreate all the tables based on the schema
    c) Populate the tables with some initial seed data

5. Set up a basic Express server with a test route, logging middleware and nodemon.
-rename endpoints
- rename helper file and functions
- test

4. Plan out your API routes and resources. Create your requirements tables similar to the one above.
    i Specify end point of handlers 
    ii Add response status & responses eg success, payload 
    iii call helper functions 

6. Implement CRUD operations using the pg package to interact with your database.
4a. Writing helper functions 
    i exporting / importing the functions 
    ii writing query text - the SQL 
    iii connecting SQL + requests code 
    iv using pool to connect to database 
    v return db result to api handler 

7. Test the API using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.
